Question 1:

1. b. Regression
2. We can handle the missing datas/values with the pandas dataframes fucnctions such as 
isna()/isnull() for finding the data having null values, fillna() for filling the missing values with some specified value, removena() is a function which removes the null values from the dataset
3. The imbalanced datas cause the machine learning model to perform poor. So, we can handle this issues by ignoring the rare food datas..
Question 2:
True options based on the networks are
1.	The network contains one hidden layer
2.	Each node(neuron) in the hidden layer takes a vector as an input

NLP Questions
1.	Tokenization
import nltk
text = “Ailaysa Paragraph”

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())

2.	Remove punctuation
import string
rem_punct = [x for x in tokens if x not in string.punctuation]

3.	Lemmatization 
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer(tokens)

4.	Stopword Removal
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
nostopword = [x for x in rem_punct if x not in stop_words]

5.	POS Tagging
From nltk import pos_tagging
pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens_nostop)

7.	Sentence segmentation
From nltk import sent_tokenize
Segemented = sent_tokenize(raw_text)

8. word similarity 
token1 = nlp("AI")[0]
token2 = nlp("human")[0]
similarity = token1.similarity(token2)

9. Frequency of Ailaysa
From nltk import FreqDist
freq_dist = FreqDist([t.lower() for t in tokens_nopunct])
ailaysa_count = freq_dist['ailaysa']

10. bigrams
From nltk import bigrams
bigrams_list = list(bigrams(tokens_nopunct)


LLM, Prompting and RAG related question (Session 3):

1. Give output in JSON object only, with no additional related text or markdown. The JSON should have the following format
{ "organization_name": "Ailaysa" }
2. translate the passage to language tamil, Please follow the original tone and same passage context in the translation

4. print(tokens["input_ids"])
